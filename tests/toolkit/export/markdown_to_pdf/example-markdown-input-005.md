# Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

## Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item


1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
1. Fourth item


1. First item
8. Second item
3. Third item
5. Fourth item


1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

### Ordered List Best Practices
CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.

### Adding Elements in Lists
To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.
